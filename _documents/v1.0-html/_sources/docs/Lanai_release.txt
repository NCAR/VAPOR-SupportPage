Dart Overview
-------------

The Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) is designed to facilitate
the combination of assimilation algorithms, models, and real (or
synthetic) observations to allow increased understanding of all three.
The DART programs are highly portable, having been compiled with many
Fortran 90 compilers and run on linux compute-servers, linux clusters,
OSX laptops/desktops, SGI Altix clusters, supercomputers running AIX,
and more. Read the `Customizations <#customizations>`__ section for help
in building on new platforms.

DART employs a modular programming approach to apply an Ensemble Kalman
Filter which adjusts model values toward a state that is more consistent
with information from a set of observations. Models may be swapped in
and out, as can different algorithms in the Ensemble Kalman Filter. The
method requires running multiple instances of a model to generate an
ensemble of states. A forward operator appropriate for the type of
observation being assimilated is applied to each of the states to
generate the model's estimate of the observation. Comparing these
estimates and their uncertainty to the observation and its uncertainty
ultimately results in the adjustments to the model states. See the
DARTLAB demos or read more in the tutorials included with the DART
distribution. They are described below.

DART diagnostic output includes two netCDF files containing the model
states just before the adjustment (*Prior\_Diag.nc*) and just after the
adjustment (*Posterior\_Diag.nc*) as well as a file *obs\_seq.final*
with the model estimates of the observations. There is a suite of
Matlab® functions that facilitate exploration of the results, but the
netCDF files are inherently portable and contain all the necessary
metadata to interpret the contents with other analysis programs such as
NCL, R, etc.

In this document links are available which point to Web-based
documentation files and also to the same information in html files
distributed with DART. If you have used subversion to check out a local
copy of the DART files you can open this file in a browser by loading
*DART/doc/html/documentation/documentation/html/Lanai\_release.html* and
then use the *local file* links to see other documentation pages without
requiring a connection to the internet. If you are looking at this

Getting Started
---------------

What's Required
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. a Fortran 90 compiler
#. a netCDF library including the F90 interfaces
#. the C shell
#. (optional, to run in parallel) an MPI library

| DART has been tested on many Fortran compilers and platforms. We don't
  have any platform-dependent code sections and we use only the parts of
  the language that are portable across all the compilers we have access
  to. We explicitly set the Fortran 'kind' for all real values and do
  not rely on autopromotion or other compile-time flags to set the
  default byte size for numbers. It is possible that some model-specific
  interface code from outside sources may have specific compiler flag
  requirements; see the documentation for each model. The low-order
  models and all common portions of the DART code compile cleanly.
| DART uses the
  `netCDF <http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/>`__
  self-describing data format with a particular metadata convention to
  describe output that is used to analyze the results of assimilation
  experiments. These files have the extension *.nc* and can be read by a
  number of standard data analysis tools.
| Since most of the models being used with DART are written in Fortran
  and run on various UNIX or \*nix platforms, the development
  environment for DART is highly skewed to these machines. We do most of
  our development on a small linux workstation and a mac laptop running
  OSX 10.x, and we have an extensive test network. (I've never built nor
  run DART on a Windows machine - so I don't even know if it's possible.
  If you have run it (under Cygwin?) please let me know how it went --
  I'm curious. Tim - thoar 'at' ucar 'dot ' edu)

What's nice to have
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| **ncview**: DART users have used
  `ncview <http://meteora.ucsd.edu/~pierce/ncview_home_page.html>`__ to
  create graphical displays of output data fields. The 2D rendering is
  good for 'quick-look' type uses, but I wouldn't want to publish with
  it.
| **NCO**: The `NCO <http://nco.sourceforge.net>`__ tools are able to
  perform operations on netCDF files like concatenating, slicing, and
  dicing.
| **Matlab**\ ®: A set of `Matlab® <http://www.mathworks.com/>`__
  scripts designed to produce graphical diagnostics from DART. netCDF
  output files are also part of the DART project.
| **MPI**: The DART system includes an MPI option. MPI stands for
  'Message Passing Interface', and is both a library and run-time system
  that enables multiple copies of a single program to run in parallel,
  exchange data, and combine to solve a problem more quickly. DART does
  **NOT** require MPI to run; the default build scripts do not need nor
  use MPI in any way. However, for larger models with large state
  vectors and large numbers of observations, the data assimilation step
  will run much faster in parallel, which requires MPI to be installed
  and used. However, if multiple ensembles of your model fit comfortably
  (in time and memory space) on a single processor, you need read no
  further about MPI.

Types of input
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DART programs can require three different types of input. First, some of
the DART programs, like those for creating synthetic observational
datasets, require interactive input from the keyboard. For simple cases
this interactive input can be made directly from the keyboard. In more
complicated cases a file containing the appropriate keyboard input can
be created and this file can be directed to the standard input of the
DART program. Second, many DART programs expect one or more input files
in DART specific formats to be available. For instance,
*perfect\_model\_obs*, which creates a synthetic observation set given a
particular model and a description of a sequence of observations,
requires an input file that describes this observation sequence. At
present, the observation files for DART are in a custom format in either
human-readable ascii or more compact machine-specific binary. Third,
many DART modules (including main programs) make use of the Fortran90
namelist facility to obtain values of certain parameters at run-time.
All programs look for a namelist input file called *input.nml* in the
directory in which the program is executed. The *input.nml* file can
contain a sequence of individual Fortran90 namelists which specify
values of particular parameters for modules that compose the executable
program.

Document conventions

| Anything underlined is a URL.
| *All filenames look like this -- (typewriter font, green)*.
| *Program names look like this -- (italicized font, green)*.

Installation
------------

This document outlines the installation of the DART software and the
system requirements. The entire installation process is summarized in
the following steps:

#. `Determine which F90 compiler is available <#compilers>`__.
#. `Determine the location of the *netCDF* library <#netCDFlib>`__.
#. `Download the DART software into the expected source
   tree <#download>`__.
#. `Modify certain DART files to reflect the available F90 compiler and
   location of the appropriate libraries <#customizations>`__.
#. `Build the executables <#building>`__.

We have tried to make the code as portable as possible, but we do not
have access to all compilers on all platforms, so there are no
guarantees. We are interested in your experience building the system, so
please email me (Tim Hoar) thoar 'at' ucar 'dot' edu (trying to cut down
on the spam).

After the installation, you might want to peruse the following.

-  `Running the Lorenz\_63 Model <#Running>`__.
-  `Using the Matlab® diagnostic scripts <#matlab>`__.
-  A short discussion on `bias, filter divergence and covariance
   inflation. <#discussion>`__
-  And another one on `synthetic
   observations <#syntheticobservations>`__.

You should *absolutely* run the DARTLAB interactive tutorial (if you
have Matlab available) and look at the DARTLAB presentation slides
`Website <https://svn-dares-dart.cgd.ucar.edu/DART/releases/Lanai/documentation/DART_LAB/DART_LAB.html>`__
or `local file <../../documentation/DART_LAB/DART_LAB.html>`__ in the
*DART\_LAB* directory, and then take the tutorial in the *DART/tutorial*
directory.

--------------

Requirements: an F90 Compiler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The DART software has been successfully built on many Linux, OS/X, and
supercomputer platforms with compilers that include `GNU Fortran
Compiler ("gfortran") <http://gcc.gnu.org/fortran>`__ (free), `Intel
Fortran Compiler for Linux and Mac
OS/X <http://software.intel.com/en-us/fortran-compilers>`__, `Portland
Group Fortran Compiler <http://www.pgroup.com>`__, `Lahey Fortran
Compiler <http://www.lahey.com>`__, `Pathscale Fortran
Compiler <http://www.pathscale.com>`__, and the Cray native compiler.
Since recompiling the code is a necessity to experiment with different
models, there are no binaries to distribute.

.. raw:: html

   <div class="top">

[`top <#>`__]

.. raw:: html

   </div>

--------------

Requirements: the *netCDF* library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DART uses the `netCDF <http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/>`__
self-describing data format for the results of assimilation experiments.
These files have the extension *.nc* and can be read by a number of
standard data analysis tools. In particular, DART also makes use of the
F90 interface to the library which is available through the *netcdf.mod*
and *typesizes.mod* modules. *IMPORTANT*: different compilers create
these modules with different "case" filenames, and sometimes they are
not **both** installed into the expected directory. It is required that
both modules be present. The normal place would be in the
``netcdf/include`` directory, as opposed to the ``netcdf/lib``
directory.

If the netCDF library does not exist on your system, you must build it
(as well as the F90 interface modules). The library and instructions for
building the library or installing from an RPM may be found at the
netCDF home page: http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/

The location of the netCDF library, *libnetcdf.a*, and the locations of
both *netcdf.mod* and *typesizes.mod* will be needed by the makefile
template, as described in the `compiling <#compiling>`__ section.
Depending on the netCDF build options, the Fortran 90 interfaces may be
built in a separate library named *netcdff.a* and you may need to add
*-lnetcdff* to the library flags.

--------------

Downloading the distribution.
-----------------------------

**HURRAY**! The DART source code is now distributed through an anonymous
Subversion server! The **big** advantage is the ability to patch or
update existing code trees at your discretion. Subversion (the
client-side app is '**svn**') allows you to compare your code tree with
one on a remote server and selectively update individual files or groups
of files. Furthermore, now everyone has access to any version of any
file in the project, which is a huge help for developers. I have a brief
summary of the svn commands I use most posted at:
http://www.image.ucar.edu/~thoar/svn_primer.html

The resources to develop and support DART come from our ability to
demonstrate our growing user base. We ask that you register at our
download site http://www.image.ucar.edu/DAReS/DART/DART_download and
promise that the information will only be used to notify you of new DART
releases and shown to our sponsers in an aggregated form: "Look - we
have three users from Tonawanda, NY". After filling in the form, you
will be directed to a website that has instructions on how to download
the code.

svn has adopted the strategy that "disk is cheap". In addition to
downloading the code, it downloads an additional copy of the code to
store locally (in hidden .svn directories) as well as some
administration files. This allows svn to perform some commands even when
the repository is not available. It does double the size of the code
tree for the initial download, but then future updates download just the
changes, so they usually happen very quickly.

If you follow the instructions on the download site, you should wind up
with a directory named *DART*. Compiling the code in this tree (as is
usually the case) will necessitate much more space.

The code tree is very "bushy"; there are many directories of support
routines, etc. but only a few directories involved with the
customization and installation of the DART software. If you can compile
and run ONE of the low-order models, you should be able to compile and
run ANY of the low-order models. For this reason, we can focus on the
Lorenz \`63 model. Subsequently, the only directories with files to be
modified to check the installation are:  *DART/mkmf*,
 *DART/models/lorenz\_63/work*, and  *DART/matlab* (but only for
analysis).

Customizing the build scripts -- Overview.
------------------------------------------

DART executable programs are constructed using two tools: *make* and
*mkmf*. The *make* utility is a very common piece of software that
requires a user-defined input file that records dependencies between
different source files. *make* then performs a hierarchy of actions when
one or more of the source files is modified. The *mkmf* utility is a
custom preprocessor that generates a *make* input file (named
*Makefile*) and an example namelist *input.nml.\ **program*\ \_default**
with the default values. The *Makefile* is designed specifically to work
with object-oriented Fortran90 (and other languages) for systems like
DART.

*mkmf* requires two separate input files. The first is a \`template'
file which specifies details of the commands required for a specific
Fortran90 compiler and may also contain pointers to directories
containing pre-compiled utilities required by the DART system. **This
template file will need to be modified to reflect your system**. The
second input file is a \`path\_names' file which includes a complete
list of the locations (either relative or absolute) of all Fortran90
source files that are required to produce a particular DART program.
Each 'path\_names' file must contain a path for exactly one Fortran90
file containing a main program, but may contain any number of additional
paths pointing to files containing Fortran90 modules. An *mkmf* command
is executed which uses the 'path\_names' file and the mkmf template file
to produce a *Makefile* which is subsequently used by the standard
*make* utility.

| Shell scripts that execute the mkmf command for all standard DART
  executables are provided as part of the standard DART software. For
  more information on *mkmf* see `the FMS mkmf
  description <http://www.gfdl.gov/fms/pubrel/j/atm_dycores/doc/dycore_public_manual.html#mkmf>`__.
| One of the benefits of using *mkmf* is that it also creates an example
  namelist file for each program. The example namelist is called
  *input.nml.\ **program*\ \_default**, so as not to clash with any
  exising *input.nml* that may exist in that directory.

Building and Customizing the 'mkmf.template' file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A series of templates for different compilers/architectures exists in
the *DART/mkmf/* directory and have names with extensions that identify
the compiler, the architecture, or both. This is how you inform the
build process of the specifics of your system. Our intent is that you
copy one that is similar to your system into *mkmf.template* and
customize it. For the discussion that follows, knowledge of the contents
of one of these templates (i.e. *mkmf.template.gfortran*) is needed.
Note that only the LAST lines are shown here, the head of the file is
just a big comment (worth reading, btw).

.. raw:: html

   <div class="routine">

...
MPIFC = mpif90
MPILD = mpif90
FC = gfortran
LD = gfortran
NETCDF = /usr/local
INCS = ${NETCDF}/include
FFLAGS = -O2 -I$(INCS)
LIBS = -L${NETCDF}/lib -lnetcdf
LDFLAGS = -I$(INCS) $(LIBS)

.. raw:: html

   </div>

| Essentially, each of the lines defines some part of the resulting
  *Makefile*. Since *make* is particularly good at sorting out
  dependencies, the order of these lines really doesn't make any
  difference. The *FC = gfortran* line ultimately defines the Fortran90
  compiler to use, etc. The lines which are most likely to need
  site-specific changes start with *FFLAGS* and *NETCDF*, which indicate
  where to look for the netCDF F90 modules and the location of the
  netCDF library and modules.
| If you have MPI installed on your system *MPIFC, MPILD* dictate which
  compiler will be used in that instance. If you do not have MPI, these
  variables are of no consequence.

` <netCDF>`__

NETCDF
^^^^^^

| Modifying the *NETCDF* value should be relatively straightforward.
| Change the string to reflect the location of your netCDF installation
  containing *netcdf.mod* and *typesizes.mod*. The value of the *NETCDF*
  variable will be used by the *FFLAGS, LIBS,* and *LDFLAGS* variables.

` <fflags>`__

FFLAGS
^^^^^^

Each compiler has different compile flags, so there is really no way to
exhaustively cover this other than to say the templates as we supply
them should work -- depending on the location of your netCDF. The
low-order models can be compiled without a *-r8* switch, but the
*bgrid\_solo* model cannot.

` <libs>`__

LIBS
^^^^

The Fortran 90 interfaces may be part of the default *netcdf.a* library
and *-lnetcdf* is all you need. However it is also common for the
Fortran 90 interfaces to be built in a separate library named
*netcdff.a*. In that case you will need *-lnetcdf* and also *-lnetcdff*
on the **LIBS** line. This is a build-time option when the netCDF
libraries are compiled so it varies from site to site.

| 
| 

Customizing the 'path\_names\_\*' file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Several *path\_names\_\** files are provided in the *work* directory for
each specific model, in this case: *DART/models/lorenz\_63/work*. Since
each model comes with its own set of files, the *path\_names\_\** files
need no customization.

Building the Lorenz\_63 DART project.
-------------------------------------

DART executables are constructed in a *work* subdirectory under the
directory containing code for the given model. From the top-level DART
directory change to the L63 work directory and list the contents:

.. raw:: html

   <div class="unix">

cd DART/models/lorenz\_63/work
ls -1

.. raw:: html

   </div>

With the result:

::

    Posterior_Diag.nc
    Prior_Diag.nc
    True_State.nc
    filter_ics
    filter_restart
    input.nml
    mkmf_create_fixed_network_seq
    mkmf_create_obs_sequence
    mkmf_filter
    mkmf_obs_diag
    mkmf_obs_sequence_tool

    mkmf_preprocess
    mkmf_restart_file_tool
    mkmf_wakeup_filter
    obs_seq.final
    obs_seq.in
    obs_seq.out
    obs_seq.out.average
    obs_seq.out.x
    obs_seq.out.xy
    obs_seq.out.xyz
    obs_seq.out.z

    path_names_wakeup_filter
    perfect_ics
    perfect_restart
    quickbuild.csh
    set_def.out
    workshop_setup.csh

In all the *work* directories there will be a *quickbuild.csh* script
that builds or rebuilds the executables. The following instructions do
this work by hand to introduce you to the individual steps, but in
practice running quickbuild will be the normal way to do the compiles.

There are nine *mkmf\_xxxxxx* files for the programs

#. *preprocess*,
#. *create\_obs\_sequence*,
#. *create\_fixed\_network\_seq*,
#. *perfect\_model\_obs*,
#. *filter*,
#. *wakeup\_filter*,
#. *obs\_sequence\_tool*, and
#. *restart\_file\_tool*, and
#. *obs\_diag*,

along with the corresponding *path\_names\_xxxxxx* files. There are also
files that contain initial conditions, netCDF output, and several
observation sequence files, all of which will be discussed later. You
can examine the contents of one of the *path\_names\_xxxxxx* files, for
instance *path\_names\_filter*, to see a list of the relative paths of
all files that contain Fortran90 modules required for the program
*filter* for the L63 model. All of these paths are relative to your
*DART* directory. The first path is the main program (*filter.f90*) and
is followed by all the Fortran90 modules used by this program (after
preprocessing).

The *mkmf\_xxxxxx* scripts are cryptic but should not need to be
modified -- as long as you do not restructure the code tree (by moving
directories, for example). The function of the *mkmf\_xxxxxx* script is
to generate a *Makefile* and an *input.nml.\ **program*\ \_default**
file. It does not do the compile; *make* does that:

.. raw:: html

   <div class="unix">

csh mkmf\_preprocess
make

.. raw:: html

   </div>

| The first command generates an appropriate *Makefile* and the
  *input.nml.preprocess\_default* file. The second command results in
  the compilation of a series of Fortran90 modules which ultimately
  produces an executable file: *preprocess*. Should you need to make any
  changes to the *DART/mkmf/mkmf.template*, you will need to regenerate
  the *Makefile*.
| The *preprocess* program actually builds source code to be used by all
  the remaining modules. It is **imperative** to actually **run**
  *preprocess* before building the remaining executables. This is how
  the same code can assimilate state vector 'observations' for the
  Lorenz\_63 model and real radar reflectivities for WRF without needing
  to specify a set of radar operators for the Lorenz\_63 model!
| *preprocess* reads the *&preprocess\_nml* namelist to determine what
  observations and operators to incorporate. For this exercise, we will
  use the values in *input.nml*. *preprocess* is designed to abort if
  the files it is supposed to build already exist. For this reason, it
  is necessary to remove a couple files (if they exist) before you run
  the preprocessor. (The *quickbuild.csh* script will do this for you
  automatically.)

.. raw:: html

   <div class="unix">

::

    \rm -f ../../../obs_def/obs_def_mod.f90
    \rm -f ../../../obs_kind/obs_kind_mod.f90
    ./preprocess
    ls -l ../../../obs_def/obs_def_mod.f90
    ls -l ../../../obs_kind/obs_kind_mod.f90

.. raw:: html

   </div>

| This created *../../../obs\_def/obs\_def\_mod.f90* from
  *../../../obs\_kind/DEFAULT\_obs\_kind\_mod.F90* and several other
  modules. *../../../obs\_kind/obs\_kind\_mod.f90* was created
  similarly. Now we can build the rest of the project.
| A series of object files for each module compiled will also be left in
  the work directory, as some of these are undoubtedly needed by the
  build of the other DART components. You can proceed to create the
  other programs needed to work with L63 in DART as follows:

.. raw:: html

   <div class="unix">

csh mkmf\_create\_obs\_sequence
make
csh mkmf\_create\_fixed\_network\_seq
make
csh mkmf\_perfect\_model\_obs
make
csh mkmf\_filter
make
csh mkmf\_obs\_diag
make

.. raw:: html

   </div>

| 

The result (hopefully) is that six executables now reside in your work
directory. The most common problem is that the netCDF libraries and
include files (particularly *typesizes.mod*) are not found. Edit the

Running Lorenz\_63.
-------------------

This initial sequence of exercises includes detailed instructions on how
to work with the DART code and allows investigation of the basic
features of one of the most famous dynamical systems, the 3-variable
Lorenz-63 model. The remarkable complexity of this simple model will
also be used as a case study to introduce a number of features of a
simple ensemble filter data assimilation system. To perform a synthetic
observation assimilation experiment for the L63 model, the following
steps must be performed (an overview of the process is given first,
followed by detailed procedures for each step):

Experiment Overview
-------------------

#. `Integrate the L63 model for a long time <#integrate>`__
   starting from arbitrary initial conditions to generate a model state
   that lies on the attractor. The ergodic nature of the L63 system
   means a 'lengthy' integration always converges to some point on the
   computer's finite precision representation of the model's attractor.
#. `Generate a set of ensemble initial conditions <#ensemblate>`__
   from which to start an assimilation. Since L63 is ergodic, the
   ensemble members can be designed to look like random samples from the
   model's 'climatological distribution'. To generate an ensemble
   member, very small perturbations can be introduced to the state on
   the attractor generated by step 1. This perturbed state can then be
   integrated for a very long time until all memory of its initial
   condition can be viewed as forgotten. Any number of ensemble initial
   conditions can be generated by repeating this procedure.
#. `Simulate a particular observing system <#simulate>`__
   by first creating an 'observation set definition' and then creating
   an 'observation sequence'. The 'observation set definition' describes
   the instrumental characteristics of the observations and the
   'observation sequence' defines the temporal sequence of the
   observations.
#. `Populate the 'observation sequence' with 'perfect'
   observations <#generate>`__
   by integrating the model and using the information in the
   'observation sequence' file to create simulated observations. This
   entails operating on the model state at the time of the observation
   with an appropriate forward operator (a function that operates on the
   model state vector to produce the expected value of the particular
   observation) and then adding a random sample from the observation
   error distribution specified in the observation set definition. At
   the same time, diagnostic output about the 'true' state trajectory
   can be created.
#. `Assimilate the synthetic observations <#assimilate>`__
   by running the filter; diagnostic output is generated.

1. Integrate the L63 model for a 'long' time.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*perfect\_model\_obs* integrates the model for all the times specified
in the 'observation sequence definition' file. To this end, begin by
creating an 'observation sequence definition' file that spans a long
time. Creating an 'observation sequence definition' file is a two-step
procedure involving *create\_obs\_sequence* followed by
*create\_fixed\_network\_seq*. After they are both run, it is necessary
to integrate the model with *perfect\_model\_obs*.

1.1 Create an observation set definition.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| *create\_obs\_sequence* creates an observation set definition, the
  time-independent part of an observation sequence. An observation set
  definition file only contains the *location, type,* and *observational
  error characteristics* (normally just the diagonal observational error
  variance) for a related set of observations. There are no actual
  observations, nor are there any times associated with the definition.
  For spin-up, we are only interested in integrating the L63 model, not
  in generating any particular synthetic observations. Begin by creating
  a minimal observation set definition.
| In general, for the low-order models, only a single observation set
  need be defined. Next, the number of individual scalar observations
  (like a single surface pressure observation) in the set is needed. To
  spin-up an initial condition for the L63 model, only a single
  observation is needed. Next, the error variance for this observation
  must be entered. Since we do not need (nor want) this observation to
  have any impact on an assimilation (it will only be used for spinning
  up the model and the ensemble), enter a very large value for the error
  variance. An observation with a very large error variance has
  essentially no impact on deterministic filter assimilations like the
  default variety implemented in DART. Finally, the location and type of
  the observation need to be defined. For all types of models, the most
  elementary form of synthetic observations are called 'identity'
  observations. These observations are generated simply by adding a
  random sample from a specified observational error distribution
  directly to the value of one of the state variables. This defines the
  observation as being an identity observation of the first state
  variable in the L63 model. The program will respond by terminating
  after generating a file (generally named *set\_def.out*) that defines
  the single identity observation of the first state variable of the L63
  model. The following is a screenshot (much of the verbose logging has
  been left off for clarity), the user input looks *like this*.

1.2 Create an observation sequence definition.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| *create\_fixed\_network\_seq* creates an 'observation sequence
  definition' by extending the 'observation set definition' with the
  temporal attributes of the observations.
| The first input is the name of the file created in the previous step,
  i.e. the name of the observation set definition that you've just
  created. It is possible to create sequences in which the observation
  sets are observed at regular intervals or irregularly in time. Here,
  all we need is a sequence that takes observations over a long period
  of time - indicated by entering a 1. Although the L63 system normally
  is defined as having a non-dimensional time step, the DART system
  arbitrarily defines the model timestep as being 3600 seconds. If we
  declare that we have one observation per day for 1000 days, we create
  an observation sequence definition spanning 24000 'model' timesteps;
  sufficient to spin-up the model onto the attractor. Finally, enter a
  name for the 'observation sequence definition' file. Note again: there
  are no observation values present in this file. Just an observation
  type, location, time and the error characteristics. We are going to
  populate the observation sequence with the *perfect\_model\_obs*
  program.

1.3 Initialize the model onto the attractor.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| *perfect\_model\_obs* can now advance the arbitrary initial state for
  24,000 timesteps to move it onto the attractor.
| *perfect\_model\_obs* uses the Fortran90 namelist input mechanism
  instead of (admittedly gory, but temporary) interactive input. All of
  the DART software expects the namelists to found in a file called
  *input.nml*. When you built the executable, an example namelist was
  created *input.nml.perfect\_model\_obs\_default* that contains all of
  the namelist input for the executable. If you followed the example,
  each namelist was saved to a unique name. We must now rename and edit
  the namelist file for *perfect\_model\_obs*. Copy
  *input.nml.perfect\_model\_obs\_default* to *input.nml* and edit it to
  look like the following: (just worry about the highlighted stuff - and
  whitespace doesn't matter)

Executing *perfect\_model\_obs* will integrate the model 24,000 steps
and output the resulting state in the file *perfect\_restart*.

2. Generate a set of ensemble initial conditions.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| The set of initial conditions for a 'perfect model' experiment is
  created in several steps. 1) Starting from the spun-up state of the
  model (available in *perfect\_restart*), run *perfect\_model\_obs* to
  generate the 'true state' of the experiment and a corresponding set of
  observations. 2) Feed the same initial spun-up state and resulting
  observations into *filter*.
| The first step is achieved by changing a perfect\_model\_obs namelist
  parameter, copying *perfect\_restart* to *perfect\_ics*, and rerunning
  *perfect\_model\_obs*. This execution of *perfect\_model\_obs* will
  advance the model state from the end of the first 24,000 steps to the
  end of an additional 24,000 steps and place the final state in
  *perfect\_restart*. The rest of the namelists in *input.nml* should
  remain unchanged.

A *True\_State.nc* file is also created. It contains the 'true' state of
the integration.

Generating the ensemble
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This step (#2 from above) is done with the program *filter*, which also
uses the Fortran90 namelist mechanism for input. It is now necessary to
copy the *input.nml.filter\_default* namelist to *input.nml*.

| You may also build one master namelist containting all the required
  namelists. Having unused namelists in the *input.nml* does not hurt
  anything, and it has been so useful to be reminded of what is possible
  that we made it an error to NOT have a required namelist. Take a peek
  at any of the other models for examples of a "fully qualified"
  *input.nml*.
| *HINT:* if you used *svn* to get the project, try 'svn revert
  input.nml' to restore the namelist that was distributed with the
  project - which DOES have all the namelist blocks. Just be sure the
  values match the examples here.

The filter is told to generate its own ensemble initial conditions since
*start\_from\_restart* is '.false.'. However, it is important to note
that the filter still makes use of *perfect\_ics* which is set to be the
*restart\_in\_file\_name*. This is the model state generated from the
first 24,000 step model integration by *perfect\_model\_obs*. *Filter*
generates its ensemble initial conditions by randomly perturbing the
state variables of this state.

*num\_output\_state\_members* are '.true.' so the state vector is output
at every time for which there are observations (once a day here).
*Posterior\_Diag.nc* and *Prior\_Diag.nc* then contain values for 20
ensemble members once a day. Once the namelist is set, execute *filter*
to integrate the ensemble forward for 24,000 steps with the final
ensemble state written to the *filter\_restart*. Copy the
*perfect\_model\_obs* restart file *perfect\_restart* (the \`true
state') to *perfect\_ics*, and the *filter* restart file
*filter\_restart* to *filter\_ics* so that future assimilation
experiments can be initialized from these spun-up states.

.. raw:: html

   <div class="unix">

::

    ./filter
    cp perfect_restart perfect_ics
    cp filter_restart filter_ics

.. raw:: html

   </div>

The spin-up of the ensemble can be viewed by examining the output in the
netCDF files *True\_State.nc* generated by *perfect\_model\_obs* and
*Posterior\_Diag.nc* and *Prior\_Diag.nc* generated by *filter*. To do
this, see the detailed discussion of matlab diagnostics in Appendix I.

3. Simulate a particular observing system.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Begin by using *create\_obs\_sequence* to generate an observation set in
which each of the 3 state variables of L63 is observed with an
observational error variance of 1.0 for each observation. To do this,
use the following input sequence (the text including and after # is a
comment and does not need to be entered):

*4*

# upper bound on num of observations in sequence

*0*

# number of copies of data (0 for just a definition)

*0*

# number of quality control values per field (0 or greater)

*0*

# -1 to exit/end observation definitions

*-1*

# observe state variable 1

*0   0*

# time -- days, seconds

*1.0*

# observational variance

*0*

# -1 to exit/end observation definitions

*-2*

# observe state variable 2

*0   0*

# time -- days, seconds

*1.0*

# observational variance

*0*

# -1 to exit/end observation definitions

*-3*

# observe state variable 3

*0   0*

# time -- days, seconds

*1.0*

# observational variance

*-1*

# -1 to exit/end observation definitions

*set\_def.out*

# Output file name

Now, generate an observation sequence definition by running
*create\_fixed\_network\_seq* with the following input sequence:

+------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| *set\_def.out*   | # Input observation set definition file                           |
+------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| *1*              | # Regular spaced observation interval in time                     |
+------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| *1000*           | # 1000 observation times                                          |
+------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| *0, 43200*       | # First observation after 12 hours (0 days, 12 \* 3600 seconds)   |
+------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| *0, 43200*       | # Observations every 12 hours                                     |
+------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| *obs\_seq.in*    | # Output file for observation sequence definition                 |
+------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+

4. Generate a particular observing system and true state.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An observation sequence file is now generated by running
*perfect\_model\_obs* with the namelist values (unchanged from step 2):

.. raw:: html

   <div class="routineIndent1">

::

    &perfect_model_obs_nml
       start_from_restart    = .true.,
       output_restart        = .true.,
       async                 = 0,
       init_time_days        = 0,
       init_time_seconds     = 0,
       first_obs_days        = -1,
       first_obs_seconds     = -1,
       last_obs_days         = -1,
       last_obs_seconds      = -1,
       output_interval       = 1,
       restart_in_file_name  = "perfect_ics",
       restart_out_file_name = "perfect_restart",
       obs_seq_in_file_name  = "obs_seq.in",
       obs_seq_out_file_name = "obs_seq.out",
       adv_ens_command       = "./advance_ens.csh"  /

.. raw:: html

   </div>

This integrates the model starting from the state in *perfect\_ics* for
1000 12-hour intervals outputting synthetic observations of the three
state variables every 12 hours and producing a netCDF diagnostic file,
*True\_State.nc*.

5. Filtering.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Finally, *filter* can be run with its namelist set to:

.. raw:: html

   <div class="routineIndent1">

    &filter_nml
       async                    = 0,

*filter* produces two output diagnostic files, *Prior\_Diag.nc* which
contains values of the ensemble mean, ensemble spread, and ensemble
members for 12- hour lead forecasts before assimilation is applied and
*Posterior\_Diag.nc* which contains similar data for after the
assimilation is applied (sometimes referred to as analysis values).

Now try applying all of the matlab diagnostic functions described in
`the Matlab® Diagnostics section <#matlab>`__.

Matlab® Diagnostics
-------------------

The output files are netCDF files and may be examined with many
different software packages. We use Matlab®, and provide our diagnostic
scripts in the hopes that they are useful.

The diagnostic scripts and underlying functions reside in two places:
*DART/diagnostics/matlab* and *DART/matlab*. They are reliant on the
public-domain MEXNC/SNCTOOLS netCDF interface from
http://mexcdf.sourceforge.net. If you do not have them installed on your
system and want to use Matlab to peruse netCDF, you must follow their
installation instructions. The 'interested reader' may want to look at
the *DART/matlab/startup.m* file I use on my system. If you put it in
your *$HOME/matlab* directory it is invoked every time you start up
Matlab.

| Once you can access the *nc\_varget* function from within Matlab you
  can use our diagnostic scripts. It is necessary to prepend the
  location of the *DART/matlab* scripts to the *matlabpath*. Keep in
  mind the location of the netcdf operators on your system WILL be
  different from ours ... and that's OK.

And the matlab graphics window will display the spread of the ensemble
error for each state variable. The scripts are designed to do the
"obvious" thing for the low-order models and will prompt for additional
information if needed. The philosophy of these is that anything that
starts with a lower-case *plot\_\ *some\_specific\_task** is intended to
be user-callable and should handle any of the models. All the other
routines in *DART/matlab* are called BY the high-level routines.

Bias, filter divergence and covariance inflation (with the L63 model)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

One of the common problems with ensemble filters is filter divergence,
which can also be an issue with a variety of other flavors of filters
including the classical Kalman filter. In filter divergence, the prior
estimate of the model state becomes too confident, either by chance or
because of errors in the forecast model, the observational error
characteristics, or approximations in the filter itself. If the filter
is inappropriately confident that its prior estimate is correct, it will
then tend to give less weight to observations than they should be given.
The result can be enhanced overconfidence in the model's state estimate.
In severe cases, this can spiral out of control and the ensemble can
wander entirely away from the truth, confident that it is correct in its
estimate. In less severe cases, the ensemble estimates may not diverge
entirely from the truth but may still be too confident in their
estimate. The result is that the truth ends up being farther away from
the filter estimates than the spread of the filter ensemble would
estimate. This type of behavior is commonly detected using rank
histograms (also known as Talagrand diagrams). You can see the rank
histograms for the L63 initial assimilation by using the matlab script
*plot\_bins*.

A simple, but surprisingly effective way of dealing with filter
divergence is known as covariance inflation. In this method, the prior
ensemble estimate of the state is expanded around its mean by a constant
factor, effectively increasing the prior estimate of uncertainty while
leaving the prior mean estimate unchanged. The program *filter* has a
group of namelist parameters that controls the application of covariance
inflation. For a simple set of inflation values, you will set
*inf\_flavor*, and *inf\_initial*. These values come in pairs; the first
value controls inflation of the prior ensemble values, while the second
controls inflation of the posterior values. Up to this point
*inf\_flavor* has been set to 0 indicating that the prior ensemble is
left unchanged. Setting the first value of *inf\_flavor* to 3 enables
one variety of inflation. Set *inf\_initial* to different values (try
1.05 and 1.10 and other values). In each case, use the diagnostic matlab
tools to examine the resulting changes to the error, the ensemble spread
(via rank histogram bins, too), etc. What kind of relation between
spread and error is seen in this model?

There are many more options for inflation, including spatially and
temporarily varying values, with and without damping. See the discussion
of all inflation-related namelist items
`Website <https://svn-dares-dart.cgd.ucar.edu/DART/releases/Lanai/filter/filter.html#Inflation>`__
or `local
file <../../assimilation_code/programs/filter.html#Inflation>`__.

Synthetic Observations
----------------------

Synthetic observations are generated from a \`perfect' model
integration, which is often referred to as the \`truth' or a \`nature
run'. A model is integrated forward from some set of initial conditions
and observations are generated as *y = H(x) + e* where *H* is an
operator on the model state vector, *x*, that gives the expected value
of a set of observations, *y*, and *e* is a random variable with a
distribution describing the error characteristics of the observing
instrument(s) being simulated. Using synthetic observations in this way
allows students to learn about assimilation algorithms while being
isolated from the additional (extreme) complexity associated with model
error and unknown observational error characteristics. In other words,
for the real-world assimilation problem, the model has (often
substantial) differences from what happens in the real system and the
observational error distribution may be very complicated and is
certainly not well known. Be careful to keep these issues in mind while
exploring the capabilities of the ensemble filters with synthetic
observations.

Notes for Current Users
-----------------------

If you have been updating from the development branch of the DART
subversion repository you will not notice much difference between that
and the Lanai release. If you are still running the Kodiak release there
are many new models, new observation types, capabilities in the
assimilation tools, new diagnostics, and new utilities. There is a short
list of non-backwards compatible changes (`see below <#Nonbackward>`__),
and then a long list of new options and functions.

In the near future we will be making substantial changes to the internal
structure of DART to accomodate both larger models and machines with
thousands of processors. We will continue to maintain the Lanai release
with bug fixes, but we will be updating the subversion trunk with new
and non-backwards-compatible code. Checking out the Lanai release branch
and running 'svn update' from time to time is the recommended way to
update your DART tree.

--------------

Non-backwards Compatible Changes
--------------------------------

Changes in the Lanai release (13 Dec 2013) which are *not* backwards
compatible with the Kodiak release (30 June 2011):

#. The DART system uses a new random number generator based on the
   Mersenne Twister algorithm from the GNU scientific library. It is
   believed to have better behavior in general, and in particular when
   it is frequently reseeded, as may be the case in some
   perfect\_model\_obs experiments. The seed in perfect\_model\_obs is
   now based on the time-stamp associated with the data, so running
   single advances as separate invocations of the executable will still
   result in a good random distribution of the observation errors. The
   seeds in several other places in the code have been changed so they
   are more consistent in the face of different numbers of MPI tasks
   when executing. The random values should reproduce if an identical
   run is repeated, but there are still a few places in the code where
   changing the number of MPI tasks results in different seeds being
   created for the random number generator, and so the non-deterministic
   values will differ.
#. The WRF model\_mod now interpolates in the vertical in log(pressure)
   space instead of linear pressure space. This is the new default.
   There is a module global variable that can be set at compile time to
   restore the previous behavior.
#. The POP model\_mod used to interpolate sensible temperature
   observations using a potential temperature field in the state vector.
   The code now correctly does the conversion from potential temperature
   to sensible (in-situ) temperature during the forward operator
   process.
#. If your *model\_mod.f90* provides a customized *get\_close\_obs()*
   routine that makes use of the types/kinds arguments for either the
   base location or the close location list, there is an important
   change in this release. The fifth argument to the *get\_close\_obs()*
   call is now a list of generic kinds corresponding to the location
   list. The fourth argument to the *get\_dist()* routine is now also a
   generic kind and not a specific type. In previous versions of the
   system the list of close locations was sometimes a list of specific
   types and other times a list of generic kinds. The system now always
   passes generic kinds for the close locations list for consistency.
   The base location and specific type remains the same as before. If
   you have a *get\_close\_obs()* routine in your *model\_mod.f90* file
   and have questions about usage, `contact <mailto:dart@ucar.edu>`__
   the DART development team.
#. The *obs\_common\_subset* program namelist has changed. The program
   compares *obs\_seq.final* files that were produced by different runs
   of filter using the same input obs\_sequence file. The old version
   supported comparing only 2 files at a time; this version supports up
   to 50. It also enforces the implicit assumption that the incoming
   obs\_seq.final files are identical except for the DART QC and the obs
   values.
#. The simple\_advection model was incorrectly calling the random number
   generator initialization routines after generating some random
   numbers. It now correctly initializes the generator before getting
   any random values.
#. The gts\_to\_dart converter now creates separate obs types for
   surface dewpoint vs obs aloft because they have different vertical
   coordinates. The obs\_diag program (and other diagnostic routines) do
   not cope with the same obs type having different vertical coordinates
   because it is trying to bin observations in the vertical (it is
   unable to convert pressure to height after the fact, for example, or
   bin surface obs with a height with pressure obs).
#. Shell scripts which used to contain MSS (mass store) commands for
   long-term archiving have been converted to call HSI (HPSS) commands.
#. The 'wrf\_dart\_obs\_preprocess' program will now refuse to superob
   observations which are too close to the poles. If the superob radius
   includes either pole, the computation of an average obs location
   becomes more complicated than the existing code is prepared to deal
   with. (If this case is of interest to you,
   `contact <mailto:dart@ucar.edu>`__ the DART development team. We have
   ideas on how to implement this.)
#. The default namelist values for the 'obs\_seq\_to\_netcdf' program
   has changed so the default is a single large time bin, which means
   you don't have to know the exact time extents when converting an
   obs\_seq.final file into a netCDF file. You can still set specific
   bins and get multiple netCDF files as output if you prefer.
#. The tutorial files are now directly in the DART/tutorial directory
   and no longer in separate subdirectories.
#. The default flags in the mkmf\_template.XXX files have been updated
   to be more consistent with current compiler versions.
#. The default work/input.nml namelists for Lorenz 63 and Lorenz 96 have
   been changed to give good assimilation results by default. Originally
   these were set to work with a workshop tutorial in which the settings
   did not work and as part of the tutorial they were changed to good
   values. Now the workshop versions of the namelists are separate and
   copied into place by a workshop\_setup script.
#. filter now calls the end\_model() subroutine in the model\_mod for
   the first time. It should have been called all along, but was not.
#. The 'rat\_cri' namelist item has been removed from the &obs\_diag
   namelist.
#. The preprocess program has a new namelist item 'overwrite\_output'
   and it is .true. by default. The program will no longer fail if the
   target obs\_kind\_mod.f90 or obs\_def\_mod.f90 files exist but will
   silently overwrite them. Set this namelist item to .false. to recover
   the previous behavior.

New Features
------------

-  Customizable Outlier-Threshold Handling

   -  Filter contains code to compute whether an observation should not
      be assimilated because the forward operator mean is too different
      from the observation value. This is done uniformly for all
      observation values and types. To customize this computation (e.g.
      to allow all obs of a particular type to be assimilated without
      having to pass the outlier threshold test), there is a new
      namelist item *enable\_special\_outlier\_code* in the &filter\_nml
      namelist that enables a call to a subroutine at the end of the
      filter.f90 source file. That subroutine can be customized by the
      user to do any computation required. See the filter namelist
      documentation
      `Website <https://svn-dares-dart.cgd.ucar.edu/DART/trunk/filter/filter.html#Namelist>`__
      or `local
      file <../../assimilation_code/programs/filter.html#Namelist>`__
      for more details.

-  Fill inflation restart files

   -  There is a new utility that will write inflation restart files
      based on values read from the console. This enables multi-step
      runs to start with the 'read inflation values from a file' option
      set to .true. for all steps instead of having to change the
      namelist after the first cycle. See the documentation

      or `local
      file <../../assimilation_code/programs/fill_inflation_restart.html>`__
      for more details.

-  New location module options

   -  There are additional options for the model and observation
      coordinate systems. Note that only a single location option can be
      chosen and all observations and all model locations must use that
      coordinate system. New options include:

      -  Channel coordinate system
      -  [0-1] periodic 3D coordinate system
      -  X,Y,Z 3D Cartesian coordinate system
      -  2D annulus coordinate system

      See the documentation
      `Website <https://svn-dares-dart.cgd.ucar.edu/DART/trunk/location/location_mod.html>`__
      or `local file <../../location/location_mod.html>`__ for more
      details.

-  Missing values in state

   -  In some models there are values which are not valid in all
      ensemble members. With this release there is limited support for
      this in DART. There are still serious questions about what the
      correct results should be if the ensemble count for some state
      vector item is smaller than the total ensemble size. Nevertheless,
      with this release we have implemented support for missing state
      vector values in the CLM Land model. There is a new namelist item
      *allow\_missing\_in\_clm* in the &assim\_tools\_nml namelist.
      Setting this to .true. will allow DART to avoid updating any state
      vector items in which one or more of the ensemble members in CLM
      have a missing value. Inflation will be disabled for any state
      vector items where one or more ensemble members have missing
      values. All CLM forward operators must test for and be prepared to
      return with a failed forward operator code if any of the
      interpolation items it requires are missing. See the documentation
      `Website <https://svn-dares-dart.cgd.ucar.edu/DART/trunk/assim_tools/assim_tools_mod.html#Namelist>`__
      or `local
      file <../../assimilation_code/modules/assimilation/assim_tools_mod.html#Namelist>`__
      for more details.

-  Different task layout options

   -  The ensemble manager has a new option to distribute MPI tasks
      round robin across the available nodes instead of assigning them
      sequentially. The first N tasks, where N is the ensemble size,
      require more memory than other tasks. Distributing them
      round-robin may allow assigning more tasks per node with a more
      uniform memory usage. This may result in a small decrease in
      performance at runtime, but it might allow using fewer nodes for
      the job and thus reduce the job cost. See the documentation for
      the *layout* and *tasks\_per\_node* in the &ensemble\_manager\_nml
      namelist
      `Website <https://svn-dares-dart.cgd.ucar.edu/DART/trunk/assimilation_code/modules/utilities/ensemble_manager_mod.html#Namelist>`__
      or `local
      file <../../assimilation_code/modules/utilities/ensemble_manager_mod.html#Namelist>`__
      for more details.

-  Different MPI communication options

   -  The ensemble manager has 3 new options for the order in which the
      communication is done when transposing the ensemble of state
      vectors. There is a new namelist option in the
      &ensemble\_manager\_nml called *communication\_configuration*
      which can have the values 1-4. If DART is running slower than
      expected, try the various options and see which is fastest on your
      hardware. The fastest value depends on the MPI library
      implementation, the type and speed of interconnect, the processor
      speed, and node memory size and so it is almost impossible to
      recommend a value without doing timing tests on the target system.
      See the documentation in the &ensemble\_manager\_nml namelist
      `Website <https://svn-dares-dart.cgd.ucar.edu/DART/trunk/assimilation_code/modules/utilities/ensemble_manager_mod.html#Namelist>`__
      or `local
      file <../../assimilation_code/modules/utilities/ensemble_manager_mod.html#Namelist>`__
      for more details.

-  Several more places where large arrays were put on the stack have
   been removed, decreasing the total amount of stack required by DART.

Changed Models
--------------

-  WRF

   -  Allow advanced microphysics schemes (needed interpolation for 7
      new kinds)
   -  Interpolation in the vertical is now done in log(p) instead of
      linear pressure space. log(p) is the default, but a compile-time
      variable can restore the linear interpolation.
   -  Added support in the namelist to avoid writing updated fields back
      into the wrf netcdf files. The fields are still updated during the
      assimilation but the updated data is not written back to the
      wrfinput file during the dart\_to\_wrf step.
   -  Fixed an obscure bug in the vertical convert routine of the wrf
      model\_mod that would occasionally fail to convert an obs. This
      would make tiny differences in the output as the number of mpi
      tasks change. No quantitative differences in the results but they
      were not bitwise compatible before and they are again now.

-  CAM

   -  DART/CAM now runs under the CESM framework, so all options
      available with the framework can be used.
   -  Support for the SE core (HOMME) has been developed but is NOT part
      of this release. Please contact the `DART Development
      Group <mailto:dart@ucar.edu>`__ if you have an interest in this
      configuration of CAM.

-  Simple Advection Model

   -  Fixed a bug where the random number generator was being used
      before being called with an initial seed.

   or `local file <../../obs_sequence/obs_loop.f90>`__.
-  PREPBUFR
   Change the default in the script for the prepbufr converter so it
   will swap bytes, since all machines except ibms will need this now.
   Documentation
   `Website <https://svn-dares-dart.cgd.ucar.edu/DART/trunk/observations/observations/obs_converters/NCEP/prep_bufr/prep_bufr.html>`__
   or `local

New Diagnostics and Documentation
---------------------------------

| **Better Web Pages.** We've put a lot of effort into expanding our
  documentation. For example, please check out `the Matlab diagnostics
  section <http://www.image.ucar.edu/DAReS/DART/DART_Documentation.php#mat_obs>`__
  or the pages outlining the `observation sequence file
  contents <http://www.image.ucar.edu/DAReS/DART/DART_Observations.php#obs_seq_overview>`__.
| But there's always more to add. **Please `let us
  know <http://www2.image.ucar.edu/forms/dart-suggestion-box>`__ where
  we are lacking.**

Other new stuff:

-  Handle empty epochs in the obs\_seq\_to\_netcdf converter.
-  Added a matlab utility to show the output of a 'hop' test (running a
   model for a continuous period vs. stopping and restarting a run).
-  Improved the routine that computes axes tick values in plots with
   multiple values plotted on the same plot.
-  The obs\_common\_subset program can select common observations from
   up to 4 observation sequence files at a time.
-  Add code in obs\_seq\_verify to ensure that the ensemble members are
   in the same order in all netcdf files.
-  Added support for the unstructured grids of mpas to our matlab
   diagnostics.
-  Fix to writing of ReportTime in obs\_seq\_coverage.
-  Fixed logic in obs\_seq\_verify when determining the forecast lat.
-  Fixed loops inside obs\_seq\_coverage which were using the wrong
   limits on the loops. Fixed writing of 'ntimes' in output netcdf
   variable.
-  Rewrote the algorithm in the obs\_selection tool so it had better
   scaling with large numbers of obs.
-  Several improvements to the 'obs\_diag' program:

   -  Added preliminary support for a list of 'trusted obs' in the
      obs\_diag program.
   -  Can disable the rank histogram generation with a namelist item.
   -  Can define height\_edges or heights in the namelist, but not both.
   -  The 'rat\_cri' namelist item (critical ratio) has been deprecated.

-  Extend obs\_seq\_verify so it can be used for forecasts from a single
   member. minor changes to obs\_selection, obs\_seq\_coverage and
   obs\_seq\_verify to support a single member.
-  Added Matlab script to read/print timestamps from binary dart
   restart/ic files.
-  Default for obs\_seq\_to\_netcdf in all the namelists is now 'one big
   time bin' so you don't have to know the exact timespan of an
   obs\_seq.final file before converting to netCDF.

New Utilities
-------------

This section describes updates and changes to the tutorial materials,
scripting, setup, and build information since the Kodiak release.

-  The mkmf-generated Makefiles now take care of calling 'fixsystem' if
   needed so the mpi utilities code compiles without further user
   intervention for any compiler.
-  Make the default input.nml for the Lorenz 96 and Lorenz 63 model
   gives good assimilation results. Rename the original input.nml to
   input.workshop.nml. The workshop\_setup script renames it back before
   doing anything else so this won't break the workshop instructions.
   Simplify all the workshop\_setup.csh scripts to do the minimal work
   needed by the DART tutorial.
-  Updates to the models/template directory with the start of a full 3d
   geophysical model template. Still under construction.
-  Move the pdf files in the tutorial directory up a level. Removed
   framemaker source files because we no longer have access to a working
   version of the Framemaker software. Moved routines that generate
   figures and diagrams to a non-distributed directory of the subversion
   repository.
-  Enable netCDF large file support in the work/input.nml for models
   which are likely to have large state vectors.
-  Minor updates to the doc.css file, make pages look identical in the
   safari and firefox browsers.
-  Added a utility that sorts and reformats namelists, culls all
   comments to the bottom of the file. Useful for doing diffs and
   finding duplicated namelists in a file.
-  Cleaned up mkmf files - removed files for obsolete platforms and
   compilers, updated suggested default flags for intel.
-  Update the mkmf template for gfortran to allow fortran source lines
   longer than 132 characters.
