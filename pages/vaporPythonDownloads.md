## VAPOR Python

#### Download and Install

The easiest way to download and install VAPOR Python is using [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/).
1. It is recommended to start with a new conda environment. Create a new conda environment. In the example below we create a new environment named ```vapor_python ```.
```yml
conda create -n vapor_python
```

2. Activate the environment
```yml
conda activate vapor_python
```
3. Install the package  
```yml
conda install -c conda-forge -c ncar-vapor vapor
```

#### Quick Start Guide

Examples to get started are provided with the package. If installed using conda on a local machine, they can be found in the following directories:

1. Jupyter Notebooks:

 ``` $CONDA_PREFIX/lib/python3.9/site-packages/vapor/example_notebooks/ ```

2. Python Scripts:

``` $CONDA_PREFIX/lib/python3.9/site-packages/vapor/examples/ ```
